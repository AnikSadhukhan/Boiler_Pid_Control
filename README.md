# Boiler Drum Level Control using PID (MATLAB)

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a power plant boiler drum and applies a PID controller to maintain the water level.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Nonlinear boiler model in MATLAB  
- PID control loop (Proportional + Integral + Derivative)  
- Visualization of water level vs setpoint  
- Control input plotting  

## 📊 Results
- Water level stabilizes at the desired setpoint using PID  
- Control input adjusts dynamically to maintain system stability  

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Open MATLAB  
2. Place `boiler_model.m` and `pid_simulation.m` in the same folder  
3. Run:
   ```matlab
   pid_simulation
